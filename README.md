# NLTK Codes 🧑🏻‍💻

- Natural language processing (NLP) is a field that focuses on making natural human language usable by computer programs.


- A lot of the data that you could be analyzing is unstructured data and contains human-readable text. Before you can analyze that data programmatically, you first need to preprocess it.

- `NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit`, is a Python package that you can use for NLP to preprocess your texts.
