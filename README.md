# NLTK Codes 🧑🏻‍💻

- Natural language processing (NLP) is a field that focuses on making natural human language usable by computer programs.


- A lot of the data that you could be analyzing is unstructured data and contains human-readable text. Before you can analyze that data programmatically, you first need to preprocess it.

- `NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit`, is a Python package that you can use for NLP to preprocess your texts.

- We can tokenize a text on the basis of words or, sentences.
  - Tokenizing by word
  - Tokenizing by sentence

## Stop Words 🛑

- Stop words are words that you want to ignore, so you filter them out of your text when you’re processing it.
- Very common words like 'in', 'is', and 'an' are often used as stop words since they don’t add a lot of meaning to a text in and of themselves.
